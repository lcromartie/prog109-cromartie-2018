        <h1>Prog 109 Home Page</h1>
        <hr>
          <p>This is my 'Home Page', the page that holds all the work Ive done so far within programming 109.
              I have created links to each one of my assignments located within their respective sections seperated
              by the weeks of the quarter. For example, assignments assigned within the first week will be located in the section
              labeled "Week One", assignments for the second week will be located in "Week Two" and so on and so forth. I have also 
              provided a section for internal navigation to help make it easier to locate the different sections.

                  <p><strong>Introduction to Web Development</strong>
                <br>
                The first week of class we learned basic html. We are 
                assigned two assignments: Basic HTML Page-Movie Description and 
                First Web Page-Resume.</p>
                <li><a href="./movie-description">Movie Description</a></li>
                <li><a href="./resume">Resume</a></li>
                  

                <h2 id="week-two">Week Two</h2>
                <p><strong>Links, Formatting and Images</strong>
                <br>
                 During the second week of the quarter we begin to go over how to post links, 
                how to format the pages, and inputting images. There were also some in-class assignments
                that I missed during this week but I will see if I can make up for those somehow.
                </p>
                <li><a href="./index.html">Github Pages</a></li>

                <h2 id="week-three">Week Three</h2>
                <p><strong>CSS and HTML5</strong>
                <br>
                 In week three we begin to explore Cascading Style Sheets or CSS for short, and HTML5.
                 HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, which provides stucture and a cleaner look for the page.
                 CSS is where you would enter the code to style the page. You can control the colors, size, layout 
                 and structure of the page. In this section are the Resume Github Pages and Git New Repo.
                </p>

                <h2 id="week-four">Week Four</h2>
                 <p><strong>Forms and More CSS</strong>
                 <br>
                  In week four, we are introduced to more styling methods and the button feature. 
                  The button feature is useful when creating forms for inputting and recording data, for example
                  filling out an application online or signing up for some type of membership. On the CSS side we 
                  explore more styling features like borders and creating themes for webpages. 
                  We also learn about cloud 9 and amazon web services.

                <h2 id="week-five">Week Five</h2>
                  <p><strong>Images, Styles and Page Structure</strong>
                  <br>
                  This week we work with images , more styling and focus on the the structure of our web pages.
                  I,ve provided links to three assignments within my repository on github. More styling features are discovered 
                  using css for the listbutton assignment. We learn how to go into a bit more detail with styling the 
                  buttons and changing the overall appearance. In page structure we are given examples of what makes
                  the page look a little more organized. We practice this to make the appearance cleaner 
                  and makes the page more readable to the user.

                  <p><strong>Box Model and Aside, Code Academy, Navigation and Midterm.</strong>
                   This week we start to really increase the workload beginning with the box model 
                   and aside assignment. For the box model and aside assignment we focus on how to 
                   edit borders around the different structures and features of the page. The aside feature 
                   can be used to provide side notes or more information depending on its placement.
                   In navigation, we learn how to navigate to specific areas of our website and webpages 
                   using a redirect element both for internal and external navigation. Code Academy is an external
                   website we use to expand our learning and practice in web developement. There are many courses
                   one could take offered from website but we are only required to take the HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
                   courses. Lastly, the midterm, which is basically what you are viewing now.
                    This home page contains the majority of my assignments.</p>
